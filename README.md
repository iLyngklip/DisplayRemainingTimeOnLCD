# DisplayRemainingTimeOnLCD
An easy way to download and install a script for Cura, which displays the remaining time of a print.

## Installation:

1) Go to the "scripts" folder and open "DisplayRemainingTimeOnLCD.py"
2) In the top-right corner is a RAW button, right click it and choose "Save link as"
3) Save the file to your Cura plugins folder. The path should look something like: "C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.2\plugins\PostProcessingPlugin\scripts".
4) Now open Cura and verify the installation worked. This is done by opening "Extensions" -> "Post Processing" -> "Modify G-Code" -> "Add a script" -> "Display Remaining Time on LCD" and then selecting "Enable".
